                <li>1 teaspoon garam masala</li>
                <li>1 (6 ounce) package frozen peas</li>
                <li>½ cup water</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon minced pickled jalapeno pepper</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
                <li>1 (12 ounce) package wonton wrappers</li>
                <li>vegetable oil for frying</li>
            <ul>
        
            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add ground beef, onion, and garlic; cook until beef is browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Reduce heat to low.</li>
                    <li>Mix in coriander, cumin, salt, turmeric, chile powder, and ginger. Add peas and water; bring to boil. Cover and simmer, stirring occasionally, about 25 minutes. Uncover and cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until any remaining liquid evaporates.</li>
                    <li>Stir jalapenos and garam masala into the beef mixture. Remove from heat and stir in lemon juice; let cool until safe to handle, at least 15 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Drop about 1 tablespoon of the beef mixture onto the center of a wonton wrapper. Moisten edges with water, fold them over the filling, and seal. Repeat with remaining filling and wonton wrappers.</li>
                    <li>Heat about 1/2 inch oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add samosas in batches; fry until browned, 1 to 2 inches per side.</li>
